      "question": "Automation 360 Control Room Upgrade guidelines from older version to the latest version",
      "answer": "Before each release update, ensure that you back up the database, repository, and installation configuration files. Ensure you are on one of the previous three releases from the latest release (on an n-3 release, where n refers to the latest release). For example, to update to the Automation 360 v.21 release, you must be on the v.20, v.19, or V.18 release. However, to update from v.15 to the Automation 360 v.21 release, you must first update to v.18 release and then update to the Automation 360 v.21 release. In the second scenario, ensure you perform the backup of v.15 data before you update to v.18, and then back up v.18 data before you update to v.21. Perform the upgrade in the lower environment first, after the application validations, Plan for the Prod Environment upgrade. Please Note that if it's a cluster upgrade, the control room must have at least three nodes. If there are just two nodes in the control room, post upgrading the control room to V.28 and later versions issues related to audit logs will arise."
